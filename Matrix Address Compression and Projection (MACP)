Abstract

Matrix Address Compression and Projection (MACP) is a novel computational architecture that enables extremely large logical address spaces (4D, 5D, or higher dimensions) to be compressed and mapped onto compact physical matrix memory, typically located in GPU VRAM. Through deterministic projection formulas, MACP allows simulation and operation of complex hardware systems (such as disk drives, CPUs, I/O controllers, and buses) entirely through matrix transformations, achieving massive storage efficiency and computational scalability.

Key Principles

Matrix-Driven Compression

Logical multi-dimensional spaces are compressed into smaller physical matrix structures without loss of deterministic addressability.

Deterministic Projection

Projection functions mathematically map logical (e.g., 5D) coordinates into physical (2D/3D) matrices with 1-to-1 consistency.

Massive Amplification

Through compression, MACP can simulate storage structures 8,000x larger than the physical VRAM footprint.

Hardware Emulation Through Matrices

Full behaviors of HDD controllers, CPUs, buses, and IO devices are created through pure matrix operations.

Applications

Virtual Hard Disks (Matrix-HDD)

Matrix-Based CPU Emulators

Matrix-Defined Filesystems

Software-Defined Storage Controllers

MatrixFlow Operating Environments

Next-Generation Matrix Computing Platforms

Mathematical Foundations

Tensor Folding

Large virtual address spaces are folded into lower-dimensional tensors using reshape and stride tricks.

Modular Arithmetic

Logical addresses are modulo-projected into cyclic physical space allocations.

Index Projection Formulas

Given logical indices , a simple example projection:



where:

 are dimension scalars

 is the total physical matrix size

State Machine Design

Each matrix cell represents a hardware state (e.g., sector occupied, data buffer, transfer queue, CPU register, etc.).

Advantages

Extreme Storage Efficiency

Near-Instant Read/Write Access (pure matrix slicing)

Hardware-Free Prototyping (everything inside GPU VRAM)

Ultra-Parallel GPU Execution (via CuPy or Tensor Core accelerators)

Foundation for Future Matrix-Based Computing Architectures

Example: 5D Matrix Disk

Logical Structure: Disk is 5D .

Projection: Map to a 2D physical matrix with size manageable by GPU.

Matrix Controller: Manages read/write commands purely with tensor operations.

Data Cells: Each physical matrix cell represents compressed logical sector data.

Implementation Notes

Preferred frameworks: CuPy, NumPy

Matrix types: float32, int16, uint8 depending on application

Address decoding must be mathematically reversible for consistency

Virtual sectors, tracks, and heads implemented as tensor dimensions

Matrix RAID possible by applying MACP across multiple virtual drives

Future Work

Deep integration into MatrixFlow for multi-CPU emulation

Matrix-Bus Controller (MACP-driven DMA and IO scheduling)

Persistent matrix filesystem layers

Networked Matrix Disks (for distributed MACP environments)

Example Projection Code (Python/CuPy)

import cupy as cp

# Define disk dimensions
logical_dims = (128, 128, 128, 128, 128)  # Example: 5D logical disk
physical_dim = 4096                       # Example: 2D matrix size (64x64)

# Create physical disk
disk = cp.zeros((64, 64), dtype=cp.float32)

# Example write function
def write_to_disk(i, j, k, l, m, value):
    idx = (i * 1 + j * 2 + k * 3 + l * 5 + m * 7) % (64*64)
    row, col = divmod(idx, 64)
    disk[row, col] = value

# Example read function
def read_from_disk(i, j, k, l, m):
    idx = (i * 1 + j * 2 + k * 3 + l * 5 + m * 7) % (64*64)
    row, col = divmod(idx, 64)
    return disk[row, col]

# Example usage
write_to_disk(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 123.456)
value = read_from_disk(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(value)

Final Words

Matrix Address Compression and Projection (MACP) is not just an optimization.It is the birth of a new computational fabric.Built correctly, MACP can power next-generation virtual hardware platforms at unprecedented scale and speed.
