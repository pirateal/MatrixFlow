# Architecture

MatrixFlow is composed of several core modules:

1. **Matrix-CPU-Emulator**: GPU-accelerated CPU instruction simulator via CuPy.
2. **Memory Manager**: Hierarchical allocation for matrices at multiple scales.
3. **Matrix-Flow Engines**: Engines for CPU, GPU, FPGA, and ASIC integration.
4. **Working-Vector-Chips (VPUs)**: Vector processing units optimized for matrix tasks.
5. **Pactor-Modems Integration**: Signal processing and RF data transmission modules.
6. **Sound Chips**: Audio DSP pipelines implemented in matrix logic.

## Data Flow
- Instructions → Matrix Transformations → Resultant State
- Memory reads/writes via tile-based matrix allocations.
- DSP and I/O as matrix filter and transform stages.
