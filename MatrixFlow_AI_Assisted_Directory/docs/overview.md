# MatrixFlow Overview

MatrixFlow is a GPU-accelerated framework for simulating and executing hardware logic through multi-level matrix operations. It replaces traditional transistor-based logic with matrix transformations, enabling highly parallel, low-latency computations without conventional clock cycles.

## Key Goals
- Emulate CPU, memory, DSP, and I/O subsystems via matrix logic.
- Leverage ultra-low precision formats (FP4, FP8) on GPUs for logic simulation.
- Build a modular, extensible pipeline for both research and real-world applications.
