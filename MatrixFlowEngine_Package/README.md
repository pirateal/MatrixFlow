# MatrixFlowEngine

The `MatrixFlowEngine` is a GPU-accelerated module that simulates digital logic operations using matrix computations. It includes simulations for gear mechanisms, adders, and finite state machines (FSMs).

## Usage

```bash
python MatrixFlowEngine.py
```

Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed:
- `numpy`
- `cupy` (for GPU acceleration)
