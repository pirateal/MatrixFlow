# MatrixFlowEngine Technical Documentation

## Overview

MatrixFlowEngine is a novel computational engine that leverages GPU-accelerated matrix operations to simulate digital logic circuits without traditional clocked gates. This approach transforms logic gate operations into tensor algebra, enabling massive parallelism and high throughput.

## Key Components

1. **Gear Mechanism**  
   Simulates mechanical gear-rack interactions using 3×3 and 3×1 matrices.  
   - Input: Binary gear and rack matrices  
   - Operation: Matrix multiplication  
   - Output: Combined gear state matrix  

2. **Matrix Adder**  
   Implements a 5-bit adder using vectorized modulo arithmetic.  
   - Input: Two vectors of 5-bit integers (0–31)  
   - Operation: Elementwise addition mod 32  
   - Output: Sum vector  

3. **FSM Simulator**  
   Finite State Machine using XOR-based state transitions within an ElementwiseKernel (GPU) or CPU fallback.  
   - Input: Binary sequences of length N  
   - Operation: XOR transition per timestep  
   - Output: Final FSM state (0 or 1)  

## Benefits

- **Clockless Logic**: Removes the need for discrete clock cycles by embedding transitions in tensor kernels.  
- **Massive Parallelism**: Processes tens of thousands of logic instances simultaneously on GPU.  
- **Software-Defined Hardware**: Emulates hardware logic in software, offering flexibility and rapid prototyping.

## Future Extensions

- Matrix-based multiplexers, ALUs, and memory controllers  
- Visualization tools for matrix states  
- Integration with MatrixFlow’s existing CPU and vector chip emulators
