# Matrix LTO Tape Controller

This project is a virtual LTO-style tape storage controller built using matrix-based logic â€” a core principle of the MatrixFlow computing framework. It simulates a software-defined tape device using positionally indexed matrix memory rather than traditional file systems or hardware blocks.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Matrix-structured virtual tape (default: 1024Ã—1024)
- Read/Write operations mapped to head position
- Seek and rewind commands
- Load/unload tape simulation
- Easy to extend into 3D/4D matrix space or RAID logic
- Aligned with GPU-accelerated CuPy upgrades (MatrixFlow ready)

## ðŸ§  Conceptual Overview

| Component        | Matrix Representation         | Notes                               |
|------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Tape medium      | 2D Matrix (NumPy/CuPy)         | Replaceable with multi-D            |
| Tape head        | `(x, y)` index                 | Current read/write position         |
| Rewind           | Reset to `(0, 0)`              | Simulates magnetic rewind           |
| Seek             | Move head to `(x, y)`          | Allows direct block control         |
| Storage          | `matrix[x][y] = data`          | No traditional filesystem needed    |

## ðŸ§ª Example Output

```
Tape loaded
Wrote 42 at (0, 0)
Read 42 at (0, 0)
Position set to (0, 1)
Wrote 99 at (0, 1)
Read 99 at (0, 1)
Tape rewound to beginning
Read 42 at (0, 0)
Tape unloaded
```

## ðŸ“¦ Future Expansion

- RAID-style mirroring using multiple tapes
- Matrix-based virtual file system blocks
- VRAM tape device via CuPy/TensorCore
- Remote access controller and GUI
- Compression and revision history using 4D matrix
