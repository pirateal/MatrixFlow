High-Speed Logic Computation Using OR and XOR Gates

1. Introduction

Through benchmarking, we have identified that OR and XOR gates execute significantly faster than AND and NOT gates on our computational architecture. This discovery allows us to construct high-speed logic circuits using a non-traditional approach, favoring these highly optimized operations.

2. Benchmark Results

Key Observations:

OR and XOR gates are the fastest, consistently at ~0.004 ms.

AND is significantly slower for small batch sizes but normalizes at large batches.

NOT gate performs decently but remains slightly slower than OR/XOR at lower batch sizes.

3. What Can We Build with OR and XOR?

Given the speed advantage of OR and XOR, we can construct complex logic circuits by minimizing reliance on AND and NOT operations. Some potential applications include:

3.1. High-Speed Full Adder

A full adder can be constructed using only OR and XOR gates:

Sum: A XOR B XOR Cin

Carry (approximate): (A OR B) OR Cin

This enables fast addition operations without requiring slow AND gates.

3.2. Multiplexer (MUX)

Using OR and XOR, we can build a 2:1 multiplexer, selecting between two inputs using a control signal:

MUX Output: (A XOR B) XOR (Select * (A OR B))

This can be extended to larger multiplexers.

3.3. Bitwise Operations for Set Processing

Union: A OR B

Symmetric Difference: A XOR B

Used in databases, AI computations, and networking.

3.4. Cryptographic Hashing & PRNGs

Many cryptographic algorithms rely on XOR transformations.

XOR-based transformations are key to pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs).

3.5. Optimized ALU Design

We can build a logic-based Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) that prioritizes OR/XOR operations.

Other operations (e.g., subtraction, multiplication) can be derived from XOR logic.

4. Next Steps

Our next steps involve implementing:

A complete ALU using only OR and XOR gates.

A high-speed multi-bit adder.

A configurable logic unit using OR/XOR multiplexing.

This approach redefines how logic circuits are built, leveraging the fastest possible operations for extreme computational efficiency.
