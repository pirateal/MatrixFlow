Technical Documentation for MatrixCPU Emulator
Overview
This document outlines the design and functionality of a MatrixCPU Emulator, which simulates a basic x86-like CPU with support for registers, memory, and several operations. The script leverages CuPy, a GPU-accelerated array library, to emulate a computational model that runs entirely on the GPU using matrix operations. The goal of this system is to explore how matrix-based computation can be applied in the context of traditional CPU architecture emulation, offering insights into how high-level operations can be accelerated using GPU parallelism.

Key Features
GPU-Accelerated Registers and Memory: The system simulates 8 CPU registers and a memory space of 1024 32-bit words, where all values are stored and manipulated on the GPU using CuPy arrays.

Basic Arithmetic and Logical Operations: The CPU supports a variety of basic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and more, all of which operate on the matrix data within GPU registers.

Control Flow Operations: The emulator implements common CPU control flow operations like jumps and conditional jumps (JZ, JNZ, JG), allowing simulation of branching logic and program flow.

Stack Simulation: The emulator simulates a basic stack with support for push and pop operations, helping to mimic real-world CPU stack behavior.

Memory Operations: The system simulates reading from and writing to memory addresses, utilizing a matrix representation for memory access.

Flag Management: The CPU maintains a set of flags (ZERO, CARRY, SIGN, DIV_ZERO), which influence the control flow during execution.

Architecture
The MatrixCPU Emulator is implemented as a class, with the following components:

1. Registers:
The system emulates 8 CPU registers, each represented by a CuPy array of 1 element (32-bit integer). These registers include:

EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX: General-purpose registers
ESI, EDI, EBP, ESP: Additional general-purpose registers (including the stack pointer ESP)
2. Memory:
Memory is simulated as an array of 1024 32-bit words, initialized to zeros. Memory operations (read and write) use the same structure to perform memory manipulations via matrix-based indexing.

3. Flags:
The flags (ZERO, CARRY, SIGN, DIV_ZERO) are used to track the results of operations, influencing the flow of the program, especially in conditional jump operations.

4. Stack:
The stack is simulated using a Python list, although in a real hardware implementation it would be handled in memory. Stack operations (PUSH and POP) modify the ESP register and simulate stack-based behavior.

Instructions and Operations
The emulator supports a variety of assembly-like instructions. These include:

MOV: Moves a value into a register.
ADD, SUB: Performs addition or subtraction between registers.
PUSH, POP: Simulates stack operations by modifying the ESP register and the stack.
AND, OR, XOR, NOT: Logical bitwise operations.
CMP: Compares two values (sets flags based on the result).
JZ, JNZ, JG: Conditional jump operations based on flags.
MUL, DIV: Performs multiplication and division operations (handles division by zero).
SHL, SHR: Shifts values left (SHL) or right (SHR).
NEG: Negates a value (multiplies by -1).
MOV_MEM: Handles memory read or write operations, using an address.
Execution Flow
Program Execution: The execute_program method takes a list of instructions, processes each one, and applies the corresponding method (e.g., mov, add, sub). Each instruction is parsed and executed on the GPU.

Instruction Parsing: Instructions are parsed as space-separated values, with the first part being the operation (e.g., MOV, ADD), followed by the operands (e.g., register names or immediate values).

GPU Operations: Each operation (e.g., arithmetic, logical, memory access) operates directly on CuPy arrays, leveraging GPU parallelism to speed up calculations and memory access. This architecture allows for efficient execution of operations without needing traditional CPU-based clock cycles or register transfers.

Flag Management: After each operation (such as CMP), flags are updated based on the results. These flags influence control flow in subsequent jump operations like JZ, JNZ, and JG.

    "MOV EBX 10",          # EBX = 10
    "ADD EBX",             # EAX = EAX + EBX -> 15
    "SUB EAX",             # EBX = EBX - EAX -> 10 - 15 = -5
    "PUSH 100",            # Push 100 onto stack
    "PUSH 200",            # Push 200 onto stack
    "POP",                 # Pop (should remove 200)
    "AND EBX",             # EAX = EAX AND EBX
    "OR EAX",              # EBX = EBX OR EAX
    "CMP EBX",             # Compare EAX and EBX
    "JZ",                  # Jump if ZERO flag is set
    "JNZ",                 # Jump if ZERO flag is not set
    "JG",                  # Jump if EAX > EBX
    "MUL EBX",             # EAX = EAX * EBX
    "DIV EBX",             # EAX = EAX / EBX
    "XOR EAX",             # EAX = EAX XOR EBX
    "NOT EBX",             # EBX = NOT EBX
    "SHL EAX",             # EAX = EAX << 1
    "SHR EBX",             # EBX = EBX >> 1
    "NEG EAX",             # EAX = -EAX
    "MOV_MEM 100 EAX",     # Write the value of EAX to memory at address 100
    "MOV_MEM [100] EBX"    # Read memory at address 100 into EBX

Running the Emulator
To run the emulator:

Install CuPy: pip install cupy-cudaXXX (where XXX is the appropriate version for your GPU).
Define your program as a list of instructions.
Create an instance of MatrixCPU and call execute_program(program) to simulate the CPU operation.
